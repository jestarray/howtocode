#|PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that rolls a tomoato from the left side of the screen to right.
Use '🍅' with (text) for an image of a tomato.
Call your compound data 'tomoato'

NOTE: Even though this problem can be done without compound data, please use a struct def
to represent position and angle of rotation
|#

#|PROBLEM B:
Reset the position of the tomato to the start when the 'r' key is pressed.
