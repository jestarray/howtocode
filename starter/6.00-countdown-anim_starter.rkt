#| PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that represents a countdown from [10, 0]. The program should 
display the number of seconds remaining and should decrease at each 
clock tick. Upon reaching zero, it should stay there and not change.

To make your countdown progress at a reasonable speed, you can use the 
rate option to on-tick. If you say, for example,
[on-tick advance-countdown 1] then big-bang will wait 1 second between 
calls to advance-countdown.

Remember to follow the HtDW recipe! Be sure to do a proper domain 
analysis before starting to work on the code file.
|#

#| PROBLEM B:
Upon finishing PROBLEM A, make it so the program 
resets the countdown to 10 when you press the r key.
Call your function handle-key
