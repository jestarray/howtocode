#|PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that walks a ladybug back and forth, from left to right, and then back
from right to left when it hits the left and right edge respectively. 
The lady bug should also render the facing direction based on the walking
direction.

Call your struct lady

HINT: We have provided you the lady bug image facing left and right as constants
|#

; =================
; CONSTANTS:
(define RIGHT-IMG enemy-bug)
(define LEFT-IMG (flip-horizontal enemy-bug))

(define WIDTH 400)
(define HEIGHT 200)
(define BG (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "green"))

(define CENTER-Y (/ HEIGHT 2))
(define SPEED 4)
