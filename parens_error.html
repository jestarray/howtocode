                <h1>Common errors</h1><p>Mismatching parens, use logic, it’s always (operator, arg1)</p><p>The operator will always always come first.</p><p>(+ (4) 7)</p><p>(4) ERROR: is an error because 4 is not an operator</p><p>Enable automatic parens but be warned sometimes it will insert 2 when you really just want one, but its most often the case you always want 2 auto-closed, same with quotes</p><p>It’s the default setting for vscode</p><p>if you delete the starting parens, look to delete the ending one.</p><p>some students keep randomly wrapping parenthesis when things dont work and I want to emphasize that you should use logic to wrap parens.</p><p>Everything has to follow &lt;operator arg1 arg2&gt; (+ 1 2) and if you need to do more you have to come back out and wrap around... which is a bit counter intutive because we like to keep adding things at the end</p><p>Notice the language is a little kind of counter intutive because we have to go back left, wrap around parens, and add stuff, e.g<br/>4 + 5 * 3 + 2 - 1 , we can just keep adding stuff to the right but we have to implcity remember PEMDAS, multiplcation happens first</p><p>when you naturally type this out in racket it feels a little weird and grooky<br/>in racket<br/>(* 5 3) ; write this first, then go back left and wrap thoose around parens<br/>kind of weird since the lot of us are right handed and prefer just tacking things onto the right<br/>(+ 4 (* 5 3) (- 2 1))</p><p>tradeoffs! you can say you hate this but the language was designed this way for a purpose, see my first videos links if you’re curious as to why parentehsis etc</p>
