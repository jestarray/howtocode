#|PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that moves a Bunch of points up.
The program starts with no points until the user clicks.
At max, there can be 2 points on screen.
Adding more than 2 points will replace the oldest point.
Notice how the data definitions for Point, None, Single, and Couple are done.
Complete the Data Design steps for "BunchOfPoints"

(define-struct point [x y])
; Point is (make-point Number Number)
; interp.
; x is where the point is in the horizontal, relative to top left
; y is where the point is in the veritcal, relative to top left

; point-x : (Point -> Number)
; point-y : (Point -> Number)

; point-temp : (Point -> ???)
(define (point-temp pt)
  (... (point-x pt) (point-y pt)))

(define-struct none [])
; None is (make-none)
; interp. represents where there is no Points on the screen

(define-struct single [one])
; Single is (make-single Point)
; interp. represents when there is 1 Point on the screen

; single-one : (Single -> Point)

; single-temp : (Single -> ???)
(define (single-temp sg)
  (... (point-temp (single-one sg))))

(define-struct couple [first second])
; Couple is (make-couple Point Point)
; interp. represents when there are 2 Points on the screen

; couple-first : (Point -> Point)
; couple-second : (Point -> Point)

; couple-temp : (Point -> ???)
(define (couple-temp cp)
  (... (point-temp (couple-first cp))
       (point-temp (couple-second cp))))

(define pt-5-250 (make-point 5 250))
(define pt-10-330 (make-point 10 330))

; union BunchOfPoints is one of:
; - (make-none)
; - (make-single Point)
; - (make-couple Point Point)
; interp. represents when there are N points on the screen

#|PROBLEM B:
Finish the Function design steps for the following functions
(in order of easiest to hardest difficulty)
move-up
draw-point
bubble-points
render
add-point
click-add
Comment out the on-mouse big-bang clause when you are finished with all

; moves all points up in the BunchOfPoints

; render : (BunchOfPoints -> Image)
; draws the bunch of points on a background
(define (render bunch) empty-image)

; add-point : (BunchOfPoints Number Number -> BunchOfPoints)
; adds a point at the given x and y
; if BunchOfPoints is a couple, the oldest point should be in the 2nd position
; TODO: Function Design

; click-add : (BunchOfPoints Number Number MouseEvent -> BunchOfPoints)
