#| PROBLEM: 
A valid phone number must be 10 digits long and cannot start with 0 or 1. A phone number is considered
to be San Francisco local if it begins with one of the following area codes: 415, 510, 650

Design a function named 'sf-local?' that consumes a string pnum that produces #true if a number is a 
San Francisco local

"4159287278" -> #true
"1415017384" -> #false
