(define-struct grocery [name price stock])
; Grocery is (make-grocery String Number Number)
; name is the name of the item
; price is cost in dollars
; stock is the number available
(define chips (make-grocery "chips" 1.00 1))

; ListOfGrocery is one of: 
; - empty
; - (cons Grocery ListOfGrocery)
(define all-groceries (list tomato lettuce cheese chips))

#|PROBLEM A:
Finish the template for ListOfGrocery
|#
; list-grocery-temp : (ListOfGrocery -> ???)
(define (list-grocery-temp grc-ls)
  (cond
    [(empty? grc-ls) ...]
    [else
     (... (first grc-ls)
          (list-grocery-temp (rest grc-ls)))]))

#|PROBLEM B:
Design a function "total-prices" that consumes a ListOfGrocery and
produces the total price of all groceries in list
|#
(check-expect (total-price all-groceries) (+ 1 1 2 3))
(define (total-price grc-ls)
  (cond
    [(empty? grc-ls) 0]
    [else
     (+ (grocery-price (first grc-ls))
        (total-price (rest grc-ls)))]))

#|PROBLEM C:
Design a function "filter-price" that consumes a ListOfGrocery and a price and
produces all groceries equal to or under the given price
|#
(check-expect (filter-price all-groceries 2.0)
              (list tomato lettuce chips))
(define (filter-price grc-ls threshold)
  (cond
    [(empty? grc-ls) empty]
    [else
     (if (<= (grocery-price (first grc-ls)) threshold)
         (cons (first grc-ls) (filter-price (rest grc-ls) threshold))
         (filter-price (rest grc-ls) threshold))]))

#|PROBLEM D:
Design a function "restock" that consumes a ListOfGrocery and a Number and
produces the list of groceries with the stocks increased by the given Number
|#
; restock : (ListOfGrocery Number -> ListOfGrocery)
; produces the list of groceries with the stocks increased by the given Number
(check-expect (restock (list chips) 1)
              (list (up-stock chips 1)))

              (list (up-stock chips 1)
                    (up-stock tomato 1)))
(define (restock grc-ls inc)
  (cond
    [(empty? grc-ls) empty]
    [else
     (cons
      (up-stock (first grc-ls) inc)
      (restock (rest grc-ls) inc))]))

; up-stock : (Grocery Number -> Grocery)
; produce the given grocery with the stock increased by the given amount
(check-expect (up-stock chips 1)
              (make-grocery "chips" 1.00 2))
(define (up-stock grc inc)
