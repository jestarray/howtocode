#|PROBLEM A:
Carrying on from 12.04, a game with a single enemy, expand the code to handle more multiple enemies!
To do this, you need to change the Game data representation!
"game-invader" will need to be changed to a "ListOf Enemy" instead of just MaybeEnemy
Think about the reprocussions of this data representation change.
A lot of functions will break and new functions will be needed to handle multiple enemies
❌draw-minvader(modify)
❌draw-all-invaders(new)
❌render(modify to draw all invaders)
❌update-menemy(modify)
❌update-all-enemies(new)
❌menemy-hit-bottom?(modify)

❌mbullet-hit-enemies?(new)
❌kill-hit-enemies(new)
