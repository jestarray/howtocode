; Weather is (make-weather String Number Number Number Number Number Number)

#|PROBLEM A:
Complete the design of "total-warm-rain" that takes a list of weather data
and produces the sum total of rainfall in millimeters on days where
the average temperature was greater than 15 degrees Celsius.

The function that you design must make at least one call to
built-in abstract functions (there is a very nice solution that
composes calls to three built-in abstract functions).

For example:
(total-warm-rain
 (list
  (make-weather "7/2/88" 21.9 17.7 13.4 0.2 0 0.2)
  (make-weather "7/3/88" 19.5 15.6 11.7 0.4 0 0.4)
  (make-weather "7/4/88" 18.7 13.7 8.7 0.0 0 0.0)
  ))
produces
0.6 because (+ 0.2 0.4)
