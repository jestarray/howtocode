Turn all ❌ into ✅ for each step you complete

1. Data Description✅
   1B. if using define-struct, write all accessor signatures✅
2. Interpretation✅
3. Data Examples❌
4. A function template that processes this data❌
|#

#|PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that animates a growing red disc and black box!
Notice how the data definition step for Disc and Box are already done.
Complete the Data Design steps for the union "Shape"
|#

(define-struct disc [radius])
; Disc is (make-disc Number)
; interp. represents a disc with a radius
; disc-radius : (Disc -> Number)

; disc-temp: (Disc -> ???)
(define (disc-temp ds)
  (... (disc-radius ds)))

(define-struct box [width height])
; Box is (make-box Number Number)
; interp. represents a box
; box-width : (Box -> Number)
; box-height : (Box -> Number)

; box-temp : (Box -> ???)
(define (box-temp bx)
  (... (box-width bx) (box-height bx)))

; union Shape is one of:
; - (make-disc Number)
; - (make-box Number Number)
; interp. a set of shapes
; TODO: Data Design 3. Examples, 4. Template

; =================
#| Functions:
1. Signature, purpose, stub ❌
2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ❌
3. Template(from data)?❌
3. Code body ❌
4. Test, review, and refactor(review all steps, ctrl+i to auto-format) ❌
|#

#|PROBLEM B:
Finish designing the functions in the following order:
grow-shape, shape->image, render.
flip-shape & handle-key are the hardest so do these last
|#

; grow-shape: (Shape -> Shape)
; grows the given shape by increasing its dimensions by 1
(define (grow-shape sh) sh)
; TODO: Function Design

; shape->image : (Shape -> Image)
; produces the drawing of the given shape
; TODO: Function Design

; render: (Shape -> Image)
; draws the image of a shape on a background
(define (render sh) empty-image)
; TODO: Function Design

; flip-shape : (Shape -> Shape)
; change the given shape from a disc to a box and from a box to a disc. 
; The dimensions should carry through the flip
; TODO: Function Design

; handle-key: (Shape KeyEvent -> Shape)
; when the space key is pressed, change the shape from disc<->box(flip between them)
(define (handle-key sh ke)
  (cond [(key=? ke "x") 
         (... sh)]
        [else
         (... sh)]))
; TODO: Function Design

; main: (Shape -> Shape)
; start the world with ...
(define (main sh)
  (big-bang sh           ; Shape
    ; [on-key    handle-key]      ; Shape KeyEvent -> Shape
    [on-tick   grow-shape]     ; Shape -> Shape
    [to-draw   render]   ; Shape -> Image
    ))
