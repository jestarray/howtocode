#|PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that displays the mouses x & y coordinates at the position where ever the 
mouse is. So if the mouse moves, the coordinates move, along with the position of the text itself.
Call your data definition 'point'.
It should look like the following image:

where coordinates are formatted like so: '(x, y)'
