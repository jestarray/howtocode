#|PROBLEM A:
Write the video game snake
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)
https://playsnake.org/

Notice how the data definition steps are done and some functions have been provided for you:
✅add-point
✅point=?

If you're struggling, write data examples of game, where the snake is eating itself, moving, etc

Finish the function design steps for the folowing functions(from easiest to hardest):
❌point-offscreen?
❌draw-square@grid
❌render-snake
❌render-game
❌update-snake
❌ate-self?
❌update-game
❌handle-key
❌game-over?(composes ate-self? and point-offscreen?)

Remember big-bang mainly needs "on-tick" and "to-draw". You can comment out the rest until later
Challenges:
Add keeping track of a score and rendering it on the top right
