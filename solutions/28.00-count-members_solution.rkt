#|PROBLEM A:
Write a function "count-members" that consumes
two lists, "lst"(the list to check) and "ref"(the list of target values). 
The function produces the number of elements of lst that
are members of the reference list "ref". 
For example:
(count-members (list 8 6 9 6 7 8) (list 6 8)) -> produces 4 
because there are two 6s and two 8s

(count-members (list 0 3 0 4) (list 0 8 5 4)) -> produces 3 
because the two 0s and one 4 appear in (list 0 3 0 4). 

Use structural recursion on lst, with ref going along for the ride, 
and use the built-in function "member?".
|#

(: count-members ([ListOf Number] [ListOf Number] -> Number))
; produces the count of how many elements of the 2nd list occur within the 1st list
(check-expect (count-members empty empty) 0)
(check-expect (count-members (list 1 2) empty) 0)
(check-expect (count-members empty (list 1 2)) 0)
(check-expect (count-members (list 7 9) (list 9)) 1)
(check-expect (count-members (list 8 6 9 6 7 8) (list 6 8)) 4)

(define (count-members lst ref)
  (cond
    [(empty? lst) 0]
    [else
     (if (member? (first lst) ref)
         (+ 1 (count-members (rest lst) ref))
         (count-members (rest lst) ref))]))
