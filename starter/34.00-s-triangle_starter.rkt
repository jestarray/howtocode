Turn all ❌ into ✅ for each step you complete

1. Data Description✅
   1B. if using define-struct, write all accessor signatures✅
2. Interpretation✅
3. Data Examples✅
4. A function template that processes this data✅

Functions:
1. Signature, purpose, stub ❌
2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ❌
  2B. if the function consumes a list, make sure a list of 2 or longer is tested❌
3. Template(from data)?❌
4. Code body ❌
5. Test, review, and refactor(review all steps, ctrl+i to auto-format) ❌

Generative Recursion Questions:
1. Include "how" the function will compute the result in the purpose statement,
instead of just the "what" in your own words.
2. Trivial Case: What is the simplest version of this problem?
3. Solution: How do I solve the trivial case?
4. Generation: How do I generate new, smaller sub-problems?
5. Combination: How do I combine those results to solve the original task?
6. Validity: Write a disclaimer on invalid inputs of the function
7. Termination: investigate whether the problem data for each recursive data
is smaller than the given data; find examples that cause the function to loop

#|PROBLEM A:
Design the function "s-triangle" produces an Image of a 
a Sierpinski Triangle, which looks like the ascii sketch below:

The animation of how this function works:
https://howtocode.pages.dev/generative_recursion#fractals_step_by_step_animation

The basic building block is a single equalateral triangle.
 /\
/__\

The generative step is to place 2 more triangles of half the side length,
1 beside and a 1 above to make our first sierpinski triangle, which THEMSELVES
will try to generate smaller ones, and so forth until it hits 
the basic building block, thus building this first one: 
   /\   
  /__\  
 /\  /\ 
/__\/__\

This is what it sort of looks like:
                               /\                               
                              /__\                              
                             /\  /\                             
                            /__\/__\
