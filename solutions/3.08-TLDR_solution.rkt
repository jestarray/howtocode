#| PROBLEM:
Design a function named 'tldr' that consumes a string and a number that is the capacity. 
If the string is longer than the given capacity, produce only the string up to the given capacity 
appended by "..." , otherwise produce the string.
Example:
(tldr "dog" 3) -> "dog"
(tldr "hungry hippos" 3) -> "hun..."
|#

; tldr: String Number -> String
; produces the string appended ... if greater than the length, otherwise produces the string
(check-expect (tldr "once upon a time" 4) "once...")
(check-expect (tldr "once" 4) "once")
(check-expect (tldr "super fantastic" 3) "sup...")

#;
(define (tldr str cap)
  (... str cap))

(define (tldr str cap)
  (if (> (string-length str) cap)
      (string-append (substring str 0 cap) "...")
      str))
