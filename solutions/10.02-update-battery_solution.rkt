#|PROBLEM A:
Finish the uncompleted steps ❌ of Data Design above for Battery and EVCar
|#

(define-struct battery [id charge])
; Battery is (make-battery Number Number)
; interp.
; id is a unique part number that indicates swapability with other batteries
; charge is the percentage charge of the battery

; battery-id : (Battery -> Number)
; battery-charge : (Battery -> Number)

(define batt-tesla-full (make-battery 1 100))
(define batt-tesla-half (make-battery 1 50))

(define batt-byd-half (make-battery 2 50))
(define batt-byd-full (make-battery 2 100))

(define (battery-temp bt)
  (... (battery-id bt)
       (battery-charge bt)))

(define-struct evcar [name batt])
; EVCar is (make-evcar String Battery)
; interp.
; name is the brand name of the car
; batt is a reference to Battery

; evcar-name : (EVCar -> Name)
; evcar-batt : (EVCar -> Battery)

(define tesla (make-evcar "Tesla" batt-tesla-half))
(define byd (make-evcar "BYD" batt-byd-full))

(define (evcar-temp ev)
  (... (evcar-name ev) 
       (battery-temp (evcar-batt ev))))

#|PROBLEM B:
In some parts of China, there are EV battery swapping stations! The battery swap should only happen if the id number of the current cars battery and the new battery matches AND if the new battery has more charge than the one being replaced

Write a function "update-battery" that consumes an EvCar and a Battery and produces the car with the potentially replaced battery
|#

(check-expect (update-battery tesla batt-tesla-full)
              (make-evcar "Tesla" batt-tesla-full))

(check-expect (update-battery byd batt-byd-half)
              (make-evcar "BYD" batt-byd-full))

(check-expect (update-battery byd batt-tesla-full)
              (make-evcar "BYD" batt-byd-full))

; update-battery : (EVCar Battery -> EVCar)
; replaces the battery of the ev car
(define (update-battery ev nbatt)
  (make-evcar (evcar-name ev) 
              (decide-battery (evcar-batt ev) nbatt)))

; decide-battery : (Battery Battery -> Battery)
; produces the the 2nd given battery if it has more charge than the 1st and is of the same id
(check-expect (decide-battery batt-tesla-half batt-tesla-full) batt-tesla-full)
(check-expect (decide-battery batt-tesla-full batt-tesla-half) batt-tesla-full)
(check-expect (decide-battery batt-tesla-full batt-byd-full) batt-tesla-full)
(check-expect (decide-battery batt-tesla-half batt-byd-full) batt-tesla-half)

(define (decide-battery bt bt2)
  (if (and (= (battery-id bt) (battery-id bt2))
           (< (battery-charge bt) (battery-charge bt2)))
      bt2
      bt))
