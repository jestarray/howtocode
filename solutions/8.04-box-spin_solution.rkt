#|PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that grows a rotating red square that is always centered like the
following image: https://howtocode.pages.dev/images/box_spin.png

Call your data 'box'
NOTE: This can be done without compound data but please use a compound data definition.
Follow the HTDW recipe
|#

#|PROBLEM B:
Make it so pressing 'r' resets the rotating square to its initial size
|#

; =================
; CONSTANTS:
(define WIDTH 300)
(define HEIGHT 300)
(define CENTER-X (/ WIDTH 2))
(define CENTER-Y (/ HEIGHT 2))

(define ROTATION-SPEED 4)
(define GROWTH-SPEED 1)
(define BG (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
