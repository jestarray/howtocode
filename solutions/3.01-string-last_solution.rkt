#| PROBLEM: string-last
Design a function 'string-last', which extracts the last character from a non-empty string.
Example:
"hey" -> "y"
|#

; string-last: (String -> String)
; extracts the last character from a non-empty string
(check-expect (string-last "hey") "y")
(check-expect (string-last "barn") "n")

#;
(define (string-last st)
  (... st))

(define (string-last st)
  (substring st (sub1 (string-length st))))
