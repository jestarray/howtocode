#| PROBLEM:
Design a function named 'tldr' that consumes a string and a number that is the capacity. 
If the string is longer than the given capacity, produce only the string up to the given capacity 
appended by "..." , otherwise produce the string.
Example:
(tldr "dog" 3) -> "dog"
(tldr "hungry hippos" 3) -> "hun..."
