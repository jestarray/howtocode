Turn all ❌ into ✅ for each step you complete
== Data ==
    1. Data Description✅
        1B. if using define-struct, write all accessor signatures✅
    2. Interpretation✅
    3. Data Examples✅
    4. A function template that processes this data✅
== Functions ==
    1. Signature, purpose, stub ❌
    2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ❌
      2B. if the function consumes a list, make sure a list of 2 or longer is tested ❌
    3. Template(from data)?❌

; ListOfString is one of:
; - empty
; - (cons String ListOfString)
; interp. a list of strings

; list-strings-temp : (ListOfString -> ???)
(define (list-strings-temp string-lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? string-lst) ...]
    [else
     (... (first string-lst)
          (list-strings-temp (rest string-lst)))]))

#|PROBLEM A:
Notice that data design steps are done above.
Design the function "fuse-strings" which consumes a ListOfStrings and
produces all the strings combined into one.
For example:
(fuse-strings (cons "my" (cons " " (cons "phone" empty))))
produces:
"my phone"
Finish the uncompleted function design steps ❌ 1-5 above
