#|PROBLEM A:
Notice the Data Definitions for GasCar, Truck, and Motorcycle are done.
Finish the uncompleted steps ❌ of Data Design above for "Vehicle"(examples and template)
|#

(define-struct gas-car [passengers])
; GasCar is (make-gas-car Number)
; interp. represents a gas car and amount of passengers

; gas-car-passengers : (GasCar -> Number)

(define (gas-car-temp gcar)
  (... (gas-car-passengers gcar)))

(define-struct truck [cargo-weight])
; Truck is (make-truck Number)
; interp. represents a truck with its cargo weight

; truck-cargo-weight : (Truck -> Number)

(define (truck-temp trk)
  (... (truck-cargo-weight trk)))

(define-struct motorcycle [])
; Motorcylce is (make-motorcyle)
; interp. represents a motorcycle

(define (motorcycle-temp mcycle)
  (...))

; union Vehicle is one of:
; - (make-gas-car Number)
; - (make-truck Number)
; - (make-motorcycle)
; interp. a set of vehicles
(define one-pass-car (make-gas-car 1))
(define two-pass-car (make-gas-car 2))
(define three-pass-car (make-gas-car 3))
(define trk (make-truck 40))
(define mc (make-motorcycle))

; veichle-temp : (Vehicle -> ???)
(define (vehicle-temp vh)
  (cond
    [(gas-car? vh)
     (... (gas-car-passengers vh))]
    [(truck? vh)
     (... (truck-cargo-weight vh))]
    [(motorcycle? vh)
     (...)]))

#|PROBLEM B:
Design a function "can-express-lane?" that consumes a "Vehcile".
Motorcycles can always use the express lane.
Cars only with 2 or more passengers can use the express lane.
Trucks always cannot use the express lane.

; can-express-lane? : (Vehicle -> Boolean)
(check-expect (can-express-lane? one-pass-car) #false)
(check-expect (can-express-lane? two-pass-car) #true)
(check-expect (can-express-lane? three-pass-car) #true)
(check-expect (can-express-lane? trk) #false)
(check-expect (can-express-lane? mc) #true)
;(define (can-express-lane? vh) #false)

(define (can-express-lane? vh)
  (cond
    [(gas-car? vh)
     (>= (gas-car-passengers vh) 2)]
    [(truck? vh)
     #false]
    [(motorcycle? vh)
     #true]))
