#|PROBLEM A:
Design a world program that bounces a cube on the screen like those old bouncing dvd logos:
https://youtu.be/QOtuX0jL85Y?si=RcYvO1G9ja515eID
We have provided you with the data definition for bouncer and some constants.
Finish working on the "process-bouncer" and render function
hint: use place-image/align in the render function
hint2: there should be 5 test cases for "process-bouncer"
|#

; =================
; CONSTANTS:

(define WIDTH 500)
(define HEIGHT 400)
(define LOGO (rectangle 50 50 "solid" "red"))
(define BACKGROUND (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT "black"))

Turn all ❌ into ✅ for each step you complete

1. Data Description✅
1B. if using define-struct, write all accessor signatures✅
2. Interpretation✅
3. Data Examples✅
4. A function template that processes this data✅

(define-struct bouncer [x y img slope-x slope-y])
; Bounder is (make-bouncer Number Number Image Number Number)
; x & y is the top left position of the box
; slope-x is the rate it is traveling in the x-axis per pixel
; slope-y is the rate it is traveling in the y-axis per pixel
