#|PROBLEM A:
Design the function merge. It consumes two lists of numbers, which it assumes are
each sorted in ascending order. It produces a single list of all the numbers,
also sorted in ascending order.

Your solution should explicitly show the cross product of type comments table,
filled in with the values in each case. Your final function should have a cond
with 3 cases. You can do this simplification using the cross product table by
recognizing that there are subtly equal answers.

For example(assume both input lists are sorted):
(merge (list 4 7) (list 1 6 9))
produce:
(list 1 4 6 9)

Hint: Think carefully about the values of both lists. You might see a way to
change a cell content so that 2 cells have the same value.
