; LetterGrade is one of:
; - "A"
; - "B"
; - "C"
; - "D"
; - "F"

(define A "A")
(define B "B")
(define C "C")
(define D "D")
(define F "F")

(define (letter-grade-temp lg)
  (cond
    [(string=? lg A) ...]
    [(string=? lg B) ...]
    [(string=? lg C) ...]
    [(string=? lg D) ...]
    [(string=? lg F) ...]))

#| Problem A:
Notice how the "NumberGrade" data definition below has been revised to describe
in more detail, sets on intervals. Write a template for "NumberGrade".
HINT: https://howtocode.pages.dev/htdp_templates#interval_cheatsheet
|#

; NumberGrade is a Natural number that falls into one of:
;- (80, 100]
;- (60, 80]
;- (40, 60]
;- (20, 40]
;- [0, 20]
; interp.
;- (80, 100] means A
;- (60, 80] means B
;- (40, 60] means C
;- (20, 40] means D
;- [0, 20] means F

(define ng1 80)

#| Problem B:
Notice How the data design recipe is already done.

Design a "num->letter" function that consumes a NumberGrade 
and produces a LetterGrade based on the following intervals
described by the interpretation.
Example:
94 -> "A"
25 -> "D"
