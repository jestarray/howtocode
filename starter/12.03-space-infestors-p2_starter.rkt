#|PROBLEM A:
We've finished the draw/render functions in 12.02 which are done above.
Finish designing the functions for:
update-tank
update-menemy
update-mbullet
update-game

The end result is that bullets, enemies, and tanks should move.
Adding key interactions will be done in 12.04
|#

; update-tank : (Tank -> Tank)
; produces the tank with its x position by its vel-x

; update-menemy : (MaybeEnemy -> MaybeEnemy)
; moves the enemy y position if it is alive by ENEMY-SPEED

; update-mbullet : (MaybeBullet -> MaybeBullet)
; moves the bullets y position if it is alive by BULLET-SPEED
; if the bullets y position hits the top of the screen, make it dead(#false)

; update-game : (Game -> Game)
; produces a game with the updated tank, bullet, and enemy movements
; <tests are omitted>

(define (main gm)
  (big-bang
      gm
    [on-tick update-game]
    [to-draw render]))
