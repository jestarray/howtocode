(define-struct point [x y])
; Point is (make-point Number Number)
; interp. self explanitory
; point-x: (Point -> Number)
; point-y : (Point -> Number)
(define (point-temp pt)
  (... (point-x pt) (point-y pt)))

(define-struct tank [x vel-x])
; Tank is (make-tank Number Number)
; interp.
; x is the horizontal position of the tank
; vel-x is which direction it is moving in the x-axis
; tank-x : (Tank -> Number)
; tank-vel-x : (Tanks -> Number)
(define (tank-temp tk)
  (... (tank-x tk) (tank-vel-x tk)))

; Enemy is (make-point Number Number)

; union MaybeEnemy is one of:
; - #false
; - (make-point Number Number)
; interp.
; #false means the enemy is dead
; point means the enemy is alive at the point position
(define (maybe-enemy-temp enemy)
  (cond
    [(boolean? enemy) ...]
    [(point? enemy)
     (... (point-x enemy) (point-y enemy))]))

; Bullet is (make-point Number Number)

; union MaybeBullet is one of:
; - #false
; - (make-point Number Number)
; interp.
; #false means the bullet is dead(not on screen/fired)
; point means the bullet is shot at the point position
(define (maybe-bullet-temp bull)
  (cond
    [(boolean? bull) ...]
    [(point? bull)
     (... (point-x bull) (point-y bull))]))

#|PROBLEM A:
Notice how the Data Design for Point, Tank, MaybeEnemy, MaybeBullet are done.
Finish the Data Design steps 3 & 4 for the "Game" struct below.
Step 3: Examples
Come up with the following data examples for "Game" where there's:
1) a tank at the bottom of the screen, with the bullet not fired yet, and a live Enemy
2) a tank at the bottom of the screen, with a bullet fired, and a live Enemy
3) a tank at the bottom of the screen, with a bullet who's position is super close to the enemy
4) a tank at the bottom of the screen, with the bullet and enemy dead
5) an invalid game that does not follow the "game" data definition types
Sketch them out at https://tldraw.com

Finish Step 4(Template) for the "Game" struct
|#

(define-struct game [player shot invader score])
; Game is (make-game Tank MaybeBullet MaybeEnemy Number)
; interp. represents the game state
; player is the tank that is controlled by the user
; shot is the bullet that might be fired
; invader is the enemy coming down at us
; score is how many enemies we have shot down
; game-player : (Game -> Tank)
; game-shot : (Game -> MaybeBullet)
; game-invader : (Game -> MaybeEnemy)
; game-score : (Game -> Number)

(define centered-tank ...)
(define not-yet-shot-game ...)
(define miss-shot-game ...)
(define shot-hit-game ...)
(define player-alone ...)
(define invalid-game ...)

#|PROBLEM B:
Finish the function design steps for:
draw-minvader
draw-mbullet
draw-tank
render
|#

; draw-minvader : (MaybeEnemy Image -> Image)
; draws the invader at its given coordinates if it is alive on the given image(bg)
; otherwise produce the given image(bg)


; draw-mbullet : (MaybeBullet Image -> Image)
; draws the bullet at its given coordinates if it is alive on the given image(bg)
; otherwise produce the given image(bg)

; draw-tank : (Tank Image -> Image)
; draws the tank at its given x coordinate at the bottom of the screen on the given image(bg)
; otherwise produce the given image(bg)

; render : (Game -> Image)
; produces an image of the tank, invader, and bullet all ontop of a background
; hint: this function should call draw-mbullet, draw-minvader, draw-tank
; <tests are omitted>
