    2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ❌
      2B. if the function consumes a list, make sure a list of 2 or longer is tested

#|PROBLEM A:
Finish the uncompleted steps ❌ of Data Design above for both Battery and Phone
|#

(define-struct battery [percent charge-rate])
; Battery is (make-battery Number Number)
; interp.
; percentage is the amount of charge
; charge-rate is the percentage of charge PER MINUTE

(define-struct phone [name battery])
; Phone is (make-phone String Battery)
; interp.
; name is the brand name and model
; battery is a reference to Battery


#|PROBLEM B:
Phones(mainly Android) have a feature where it will tell you how long it will take to charge:
"<current-percentage>% 19 m until full"

https://howtocode.pages.dev/images/charge_info.png
(don't worry about spacing percentange and minutes left into new lines)

We are only concerned with minutes, no need to convert them to hours(challenge yourself ;))
In the case of fully charged:
"Fully charged"

Design a function "charge-message" that consumes a Phone and provides the given purpose above.
