; A Year is a non-negative integer
; Examples:
;   0
;   1789
;   2018
; Non-examples:
;   -5000
;   "AD 2018"

; A Month is one of:
; - "January"
; - "February"
; - "March"
; - "April"
; - "May"
; - "June"
; - "July"
; - "August"
; - "September"
; - "October"
; - "November"
; - "December"

; A Day is an integer at least 1 but at most 31
; Examples:
;   1
;   10
;   31
; Non-examples:
;   32
;   "today"

; A MonthFormat is one of:
; - "long"
; - "short"

; A DateOrder is one of:
; - "MDY"
; - "DMY"

(define (date-order-temp order)
  (cond
    [(string=? order "MDY") ...]
    [(string=? order "DMY") ...]))

#|PROBLEM:
Notice this problem introduces several new data defintions:
"Day", and "Year", and "DateOrder"
with some parts of the design recipe done already.
Finish the template for DateOrder

Copy over the "format-month" function previously done
and use it here to finish this function.
