; ListOfString is one of:
; - empty
; - (cons String ListOfString)
; interp. a list of strings

; list-strings-temp : (ListOfString -> ???)
(define (list-strings-temp string-lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? string-lst) ...]
    [else
     (... (first string-lst)
          (list-strings-temp (rest string-lst)))]))

#|PROBLEM A:
Notice that data design steps are done above.
Design the function "has-long-string?" that consumes a ListOfString
and produces #true IF AND ONLY if the list contains
AT LEAST ONE string that is 9 or longer.
For example:
(has-long-string? (cons "dog" empty)) -> #false
(has-long-string? (cons "meow" (cons "butterfly" empty))) -> #true
Finish the uncompleted function design steps ❌ 1-5 above
|#

; has-long-string? : (ListOfString -> Boolean)
; produces #true if the given list has a string that is 9 or longer
(check-expect (has-long-string? empty) #false)
(check-expect (has-long-string? (cons "butterfly" empty)) #true)
(check-expect (has-long-string? (cons "meow" (cons "butterfly" empty))) #true)
;(define (only-shorts string-lst) empty)

(define (has-long-string? string-lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? string-lst) #false]
    [else
     (or (>= (string-length (first string-lst)) 9)
         (has-long-string? (rest string-lst)))]))
