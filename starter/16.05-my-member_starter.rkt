Turn all ❌ into ✅ for each step you complete
== Data ==
    1. Data Description✅
        1B. if using define-struct, write all accessor signatures✅
    2. Interpretation✅
    3. Data Examples✅
    4. A function template that processes this data✅
== Functions ==
    1. Signature, purpose, stub ❌
    2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ❌
      2B. if the function consumes a list, make sure a list of 2 or longer is tested ❌
    3. Template(from data)?❌
    4. Code body ❌
    5. Test, review, and refactor(review all steps, ctrl+i to auto-format) ❌

; ListOfAny is one of:
; - empty
; - (cons Any ListOfAny)
; interp. a list of Anything

; list-any-temp : (ListOfAny -> ???)
(define (list-any-temp any-lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? any-lst) ...]
    [else
     (... (first any-lst)
          (list-any-temp (rest any-lst)))]))

#|PROBLEM A:
Notice that data design steps are done above.
Design the function "my-member" that consumes a ListOfAny
and produces #true
if the given value is in the list:
For example:
(my-member "bob" (cons 2 (cons "bob" (cons 99 empty))))
produces:
#true
Finish the uncompleted function design steps ❌ 1-5 above
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE the BSL function "member"
|#

; my-member : (Any ListOfAny -> Boolean)
; produces #true if the given value is in the list
