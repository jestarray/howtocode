#|PROBLEM A:
Finish the template for ListOfGrocery
|#
; list-grocery-temp : (ListOfGrocery -> ???)
; TODO

#|PROBLEM B:
Design a function "total-prices" that consumes a ListOfGrocery and
produces the total price of all groceries in list
|#

#|PROBLEM C:
Design a function "filter-price" that consumes a ListOfGrocery and a price and
produces all groceries equal to or under the given price
|#

#|PROBLEM D:
Design a function "restock" that consumes a ListOfGrocery and a Number and
produces the list of groceries with the stocks increased by the given Number
