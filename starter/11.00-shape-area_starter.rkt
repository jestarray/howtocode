#|PROBLEM A:
Notice the Data Definitions for Square, Rect, and Triangle are done.
Finish the uncompleted steps ❌ of Data Design above for "Shape"(examples and template)
|#
(define-struct square [side])
; Square is (make-square Number)
; interp.
; side is the length of all

; square-side : (Square -> Number)

; square-temp : (Rect -> ???)
(define (square-temp sq)
  (... (square-side sq)))

(define-struct rect [width height])
; Rect is (make-rect Number Number)
; interp.
; width is the horizontal edge of the rectangle
; height is the vertical edge of the rectangle

; rect-width : (Rect -> Number)
; rect-height : (Rect -> Number)

; rect-temp : (Rect -> ???)
(define (rect-temp rec)
  (... (rect-width rec) (rect-height rec)))

(define-struct triangle [base height])
; Triangle is (make-triangle Number Number)
; interp.
; base is the horizontal base of the trinagle
; height is the maximum vertical distance of a triangle

; triangle-base : (Triangle -> Number)
; triangle-height : (Triangle -> Number)

; triangle-temp : (Triangle -> ???)
(define (triangle-temp cr)
  (... (triangle-base cr) (triangle-height cr)))

; union Shape is one of:
; - (make-rect Number Number)
; - (make-triangle Number Number)
; - (make-square Number)
; interp. a set of shapes

; TODO: 3. Examples and 4.Template

#|PROBLEM B:
Design a function "shape-area" that consumes a "Shape" and produces the area of the given shape.
The formulas are:
area of a triangle : base * height
area of a rect : width * height
area of a square is : side * side
|#

; shape-area : (Shape -> Number)
