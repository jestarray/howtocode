#|PROBLEM A:
Notice how the data definition steps are done.
Some parts of the 12.01 bubble-points have been brought over to this file
✅ move-up
✅ draw-point

Finish the function design steps for the folowing functions:
❌bubble-all-points
❌render-all-points
❌click-add
It is recommended you look back to 12.01 bubble-points for inspiration if needed

Uncomment out the on-mouse big-bang clause when you are finished with all
