#| PROBLEM: 
Design a function named 'pig-latin', translates english to piglatin.

Pig latin is a dumb language to modify words to sound funny. There are many pig-latin rules but
for now assume it is just taking the first letter of the word and adding an "ay" at the end.
For example:
"dog" -> "ogday"
"happy" -> "appyhay"
Assume that the string is never empty
