#| PROBLEM: formalize
We have provided helper functions: string-first, string-rest, from the previous problem, use them!

On smartphones, whenever you text someone it will auto-capitalize the first letter of a word, e.g:
"hey guys" -> "Hey guys"
"where u at?" -> "Where u at?"
"wotcha doin" -> "Wotcha doin"
Design a function named 'formalize' that will capitalize the first letter of a sentence. Assume that 
a string is not empty.

; string-first: (String -> String)
; extracts the first character from a non-empty-string
(define (string-first st)
  (substring st 0 1))

; string-rest: (String -> String)
; produces the given string with the first character removed
(define (string-rest st)
  (substring st 1 (string-length st)))

; formalize: (String -> String)
; produces a string capitalizing the first letter
(check-expect (formalize "hey guys") "Hey guys")
(check-expect (formalize "where u at?") "Where u at?")

; template 
; (define (formalize txt)
;    (... txt))

(define (formalize txt)
   (string-append (string-upcase (string-first txt)) (string-rest txt)))
