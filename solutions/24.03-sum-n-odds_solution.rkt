#|PROBLEM A:
Complete the design of the following function, by writing out
the final function definition. Use at least one built in abstract
function.

HINT: The first n odd numbers are contained within the range of the first 
2*n numbers
For example:
You need to make a list of 2*n to get the first n odd numbers
Let's say n=2(I want the first 2 odd numbers)
You need a 2*n list:(2*2=4
(list 0 1 2 3) contains the first 4 numbers
which will contain the first 
2 odd numbers.

Check the website for hints, you can use "odd?"

(: sum-n-odds (Number -> Number))
; produce the sum of the first n odd numbers
(check-expect (sum-n-odds 0) 0)
(check-expect (sum-n-odds 1) (+ 0 1))
(check-expect (sum-n-odds 3) (+ 0 1 3 5))

; solution 1
#;
(define (sum-n-odds n)
  (foldr + 0 (filter odd? (build-list (* 2 n) identity))))

; solution 2
(define (sum-n-odds n)
  (local
    [(define (multiply i)
       (+ (* 2 i) 1))]
    (foldr + 0 (build-list n multiply))))
