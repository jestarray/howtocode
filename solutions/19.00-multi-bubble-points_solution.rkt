Turn all ❌ into ✅ for each step you complete

1. Data Description✅
   1B. if using define-struct, write all accessor signatures✅
2. Interpretation✅
3. Data Examples✅
4. A function template that processes this data✅

(define-struct point [x y])
; Point is (make-point Number Number)
; interp.
; x is where the point is in the horizontal, relative to top left
; y is where the point is in the veritcal, relative to top left

(define pt-5-250 (make-point 5 250))
(define pt-10-330 (make-point 10 330))

; point-temp : (Point -> ???)
(define (point-temp pt)
  (... (point-x pt) (point-y pt)))

; ListOfPoint is one of:
; - empty
; - (cons Point ListOfPoint)

#| Functions:
1. Signature, purpose, stub ✅
2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ✅
  2B. if the function consumes a list, make sure a list of 2 or longer is tested✅
3. Template(from data)?✅
3. Code body ✅
4. Test, review, and refactor(review all steps, ctrl+i to auto-format) ✅
|#

#|PROBLEM A:
Notice how the data definition steps are done.
Some parts of the 12.01 bubble-points have been brought over to this file
✅ move-up
✅ draw-point

Finish the function design steps for the folowing functions:
✅bubble-all-points
✅render-all-points
✅click-add
It is recommended you look back to 12.01 bubble-points for inspiration if needed

Uncomment out the on-mouse big-bang clause when you are finished with all
