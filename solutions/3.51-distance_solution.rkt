#| PROBLEM: 
Design a function named 'distance' that consumes 4 numbers: x1, y1, and x2, y2 and calculates
the distance between the two points using the distance formula as described here:
  __________________________
\/ (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2

|#

; Number Number Number Number -> Number
; produces the distance between the two given points

(check-expect (distance 3 0 0 4) 5)
(check-within (distance 0 1 1 0) (sqrt 2) .00001)

; template
#;
(define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
    (... x1 y1 x2 y2))

(define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
    (sqrt (+ (sqr (- x2 x1))
             (sqr (- y2 y1)))))
