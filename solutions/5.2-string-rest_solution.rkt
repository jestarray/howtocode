#| PROBLEM: string-rest
Design the function 'string-rest', which produces a string like the given one with the first character removed.
Example:
"room" -> "oom"
|#

; string-rest: (String -> String)
; produces the given string with the first character removed
(check-expect (string-rest "woah") "oah")
(check-expect (string-rest "omg") "mg")

#;
(define (string-rest st)
  (... st))

(define (string-rest st)
  (substring st 1 (string-length st)))
