; ListOfNumber is one of:
; - (cons Number empty)
; - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
; interp. a list of numbers

; list-nums-temp : (ListOfNumber -> ???)
(define (list-nums-temp num-lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? num-lst) ...]
    [else
     (... (first num-lst)
          (list-nums-temp (rest num-lst)))]))

#|PROBLEM A:
Notice that data design steps are done above.
Design a function snoc that behaves like the opposite of cons.
It consumes a number and a list of numbers,
and produces a new list in which n has been inserted at the END of the list.
For example:
(snoc 3 (cons 1 (cons 2 empty)))
produces:
(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 empty))).
Use the pattern above, treating n as auxiliary data.
Finish the uncompleted function design steps ❌ 1-5 above

; snoc : (Number ListOfNumber -> ListOfNumber)
; produces a list where N is put at the end of the list(most right side)
