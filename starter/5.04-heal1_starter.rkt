#|PROBLEM A:
Consider a video game where you need to represent the health of your
character. The only thing that matters about their health is:

- if they are dead (which is shockingly poor health)
- if they are alive then they can have 0 or more extra lives

Design a data definition called Health to represent the health of your
character. You must use at least 2 types of data!
|#

#|PROBLEM B:
Design a function called "heal1" that allows you to increase the
lives of a character. The function should only increase the lives
of the character if the character is not dead, otherwise the character
remains dead.
