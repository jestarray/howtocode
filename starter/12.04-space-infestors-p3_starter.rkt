#|PROBLEM A:
Carrying on from 12.03 bringing over update-tank, update-menemy, update-mbullet, update-game
The "distance" function is given to you in this problem
Ranked from easiest to hardest:
Finish desinging the functions:
can-fire-bullet?
check-win-lose?
bullet-hit-enemy?
handle-key
and finally:
Adjust the "update-game" function to fullfill its updated purpose
|#

; can-fire-bullet? : (MaybeBullet -> MaybeBullet)
; produces #true if the bullet is dead or hit the top of the canvas

; check-win-lose? : (Game -> Boolean)
; produces #true if the game-score is higher than 3
; or if the enemy reaches the bottom of the screen
(define (check-win-lose? gm) #false)

; menemy-hit-bottom? : (MaybeEnemy -> Boolean)
; produces #true if the given invaders y position is > HEIGHT of the game

; bullet-hit-enemy? : (MaybeBullet MaybeEnemy -> Boolean)
; produces #true if the the MaybeBullet and MaybeEnemy touch
; hint: use distance
(define (bullet-hit-enemy? bull enemy) #false)

; handle-key : (Game KeyEvent -> Game)
; produce a game where:
; if the "a" key is pressed, the tanks vel-x moves left
; if the "d" key is pressed, the tanks vel-x moves right
; if the space key is pressed, check to see if we "can-fire-bullet?" ...
; ^ adding the bullet into the game if so
; otherwise the game should continue on

; produces a game with the updated tank, bullet, and enemy movements
; if the bullet hits the enemy, produce a game with the bullet removed
