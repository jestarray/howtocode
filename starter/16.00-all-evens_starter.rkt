== Data ==
    1. Data Description✅

    2. Interpretation✅
    3. Data Examples✅
    4. A function template that processes this data✅
== Functions ==
    1. Signature, purpose, stub ❌
    2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ❌
      2B. if the function consumes a list, make sure a list of 2 or longer is tested ❌
    3. Template(from data)?❌

; ListOfNumber is one of:
; - empty
; - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
; interp. a list of numbers
(define (list-nums-temp num-lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? num-lst) ...]
    [else
     (... (first num-lst)
          (list-nums-temp (rest num-lst)))]))

#|PROBLEM A:
Notice that data design steps are done above.
Design the function "all-evens?" which consumes a ListOfNumbers
and produces #true if there are ONLY evens in the list
For example:
(all-evens? empty) -> #true
(all-evens? (cons 2 (cons 3 empty))) -> #false
(all-evens? (cons 4 (cons 6 empty))) -> #true
Finish the uncompleted function design steps ❌ 1-5 above
