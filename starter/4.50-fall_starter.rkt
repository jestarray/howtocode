; A Month is one of:
; - "January"
; - "February"
; - "March"
; - "April"
; - "May"
; - "June"
; - "July"
; - "August"
; - "September"
; - "October"
; - "November"
; - "December"

; month-temp: (Month -> ???)

#|PROBLEM:
Notice how some parts of the data definitions recipe
have been done for "Month". Finish writing the template.

Design the function "fall?" that decides whether the 
given month is between [September and November].
