Turn all ❌ into ✅ for each step you complete

1. Data Description✅
   1B. if using define-struct, write all accessor signatures✅
2. Interpretation✅
3. Data Examples✅
4. A function template that processes this data✅

Functions:
1. Signature, purpose, stub ❌
2. Examples (aka check-expect/tests, elaborate the concrete) ❌
  2B. if the function consumes a list, make sure a list of 2 or longer is tested❌
3. Template(from data)?❌
4. Code body ❌
5. Test, review, and refactor(review all steps, ctrl+i to auto-format) ❌

Generative Recursion Questions:
1. Include "how" the function will compute the result in the purpose statement,
instead of just the "what" in your own words.
2. Trivial Case: What is the simplest version of this problem?
3. Solution: How do I solve the trivial case?
4. Generation: How do I generate new, smaller sub-problems?
5. Combination: How do I combine those results to solve the original task?
6. Validity: Write a disclaimer on invalid inputs of the function
7. Termination: investigate whether the problem data for each recursive data 
is smaller than the given data; find examples that cause the function to loop

; ############################################################################

; A ListOfNumber is one of:
; - empty
; - (cons Number ListOfNumber)

; list-nums-temp : (ListOfNumber -> ???)
#;
(define (list-nums-temp lst)
  (cond
    [(empty? lst) ...]
    [else
     (... (first lst)
          (list-nums-temp (rest lst)))]))

#|PROBLEM A:
Design the function "linear-search". It consumes a list of Numbers
and a natural number N which is the Number we're trying to find.
Produce #true if the given number is in the list
NOTE: You cannot use "member?"
|#

(: linear-search ([ListOf Number] Number -> Boolean))
; produces #true if the number exists within the given list
(check-expect (linear-search empty 2) #false)
(check-expect (linear-search (list 7) 7) #true)
(check-expect (linear-search (list 8 4) -5) #false)
(check-expect (linear-search (list 9 3 8) 8) #true)
(define (linear-search lst find-num) #false)
; TODO: TEMPLATE AND CODE

#|PROBLEM B:
Design the function "binary-search". It consumes a list of Numbers
and a natural number N which is the Number we're trying to find.
Produce #true if the given number is in the list.
Note that binary-search ONLY works
if the input list is SORTED from least to greatest
For example:
(binary-serach (list 5 9 10) 9) => #true

This would be in invalid use because the list is NOT sorted
(binary-search (list 5 10 9) 9)

It searches a number like humans searching a word in the dictionary, in that
you open the book approximately in the middle & flip left and right
to get closer to what you're trying to find.

The algorithm is:
1. Find the Middle: Look at the element in the exact center of your current range.
2. Compare: * If the middle number is your target, you’re done!
3. If your target is smaller than the middle, you know it must be in the left half.
4. If your target is larger than the middle, it must be in the right half.
Repeat: Eliminate the half where the target can't be, 
and repeat the process on the remaining half until you find the number or run out of list.

|#

(: binary-search ([ListOf Number] Number -> Boolean))
; produces #true if the number exists within the given list
; ASSUMES the list is already sorted
; how?: searches it by eliminating half of the problem step
(define (binary-search lst find-num) #false)

#|BENCHMARK:
This animation shows the differences between linear vs binary search:

Play around with benchmarking the two searches with large lists
and see which is faster.
