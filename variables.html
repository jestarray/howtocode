                <h1>Variables</h1><h2 id="what_are_variables?"><a class="anchor" href="#what_are_variables?">#</a>What are variables?</h2><p>Variables give names to values which can then be used to better understand the program better and make it easier to CHANGE a program.</p><p>Here’s a value:</p><p>5</p><p>What the heck does it mean? what units? dollars? feet? inches? meter? gas prices? it can mean anything. If we give it a name by creating a variable:</p><h2 id="the_rules_for_creating_a_variable_are:"><a class="anchor" href="#the_rules_for_creating_a_variable_are:">#</a>The rules for creating a variable are:</h2><pre class="line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces"><code class="language-racket">(define &lt;SOMENAME&gt; &lt;VALUE&gt;)</code></pre><p>Let’s create a few</p><pre class="line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces"><code class="language-racket">; its much clear what it 5 means.
(define potion-price 5)
; here's another
(define amount-buying 10)

; we can then use these variables in a calcuation:
(* potion-price amount-buying)
; and it's clear what that calculation means, it's the total

; the rules for evaluatings each variable is that 
; they are substitued for the value they hold:
(* potion-price amount-buying)
(* 5 amount-buying) ; step 1
(* 5 10) ; step 2
50 ; finally becomes 50

; if we declare constants, it makes it a breeze to CHANGE size
; just CHANGE the WIDTH and HEIGHT lines and everything will adapt

(place-image
 (text "+" 50 "black")
 (/ 400 2) ; CHANGE
 (/ 300 2) ; CHANGE
 (empty-scene 400 300)) ; CHANGE, CHANGE
</code></pre><p>The above requires 4 CHANGEs! With variables we can declare constants and only CHANGE 2 places.</p><pre class="line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces"><code class="language-racket">(require 2htdp/image)
; if we declare constants, it makes it a breeze to CHANGE size
; just CHANGE the WIDTH and HEIGHT lines and everything will adapt
(define WIDTH 400) ; CHANGE
(define HEIGHT 300) ; CHANGE
(define CENTER-X (/ WIDTH 2))
(define CENTER-Y (/ HEIGHT 2))

(place-image
 (text "+" 50 "black")
 CENTER-X
 CENTER-Y
 (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
</code></pre><p>We could also CHANGE the entire shape by having the width and height be computed with image-width and image-height, making the lines we need to change go down to 1 for this example:</p><pre class="line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces"><code class="language-racket">(require 2htdp/image)
; with this we can easily swap out the shape in 1 line:
; it can be any size, rest of the code will just adapt
(define SHAPE (circle 100 "solid" "green")) ; CHANGE

(define WIDTH (image-width SHAPE))
(define HEIGHT (image-width SHAPE))
(define CENTER-X (/ WIDTH 2))
(define CENTER-Y (/ HEIGHT 2))

(place-image
 (text "+" 50 "black")
 CENTER-X
 CENTER-Y
 SHAPE)
</code></pre><p>Here’s one last example:</p><pre class="line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces"><code class="language-racket">; say you are creating a game and at the start of the game you want to greet your users
; if you wanted to CHANGE the name of your game later on to something else, like Asura
; you would have to edit 4 lines(or more):
"Welcome to Eternia"
"Join Server 1 of Eternia"
"Join Server 2 of Eternia"
"Are you sure you want to leave Eternia?"

; we can instead identify the constant information and put it in a variable
; this is sometimes called "(re)factoring"
; by convention constant variable definitions are in all caps
(define NAME "Asura") ; all we have to do is CHANGE this line
(string-append "Welcome to " NAME)
(string-append "Join Server 1 " NAME)
(string-append "Join Server 2 " NAME)
(string-append "Are you sure you want to leave " NAME)
