#|PROBLEM A:
Carrying on from 25.01, expand space-infestors to behave like the original:
Spawn enemies in a gridlike fashion,
Move side to side before moving down,

NOTE: This starter file contains spoilers of what to do.
Challenge yourself by starting off with 25.01 solution!
Making the invaders move sideways requires the Game to have a "invader-vel-x", which has been done for you.
